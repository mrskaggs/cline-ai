# Performance Optimization Plan - Current Code

## üéØ Optimization Opportunities Identified

### 1. **CPU-Intensive Operations**
**Current Issues:**
- Planning cadence: 50 ticks (too frequent for early game)
- Construction cadence: 10 ticks (could be optimized)
- Traffic analysis running when not needed
- Room memory updates every 10 ticks

**Optimizations:**
- Adjust cadences based on RCL (less frequent at lower RCL)
- Disable traffic analysis until RCL 3+ (when roads matter more)
- Reduce memory update frequency for stable rooms

### 2. **Creep Body Optimization**
**Current Issues:**
- Bodies not optimized for specific RCL energy caps
- Some inefficient body combinations
- Not leveraging full energy capacity at each RCL

**Optimizations:**
- RCL 2 specific bodies for 300 energy cap
- More efficient WORK/CARRY/MOVE ratios
- Specialized bodies for different tasks

### 3. **Population Tuning**
**Current Issues:**
- May be spawning too many/few creeps for optimal efficiency
- Builder population not optimized for construction phases
- Upgrader count could be tuned for faster RCL progression

**Optimizations:**
- Fine-tune population targets based on energy income
- Dynamic population based on room state
- Prioritize upgraders for faster RCL progression

### 4. **Memory and Logging Optimization**
**Current Issues:**
- Logging level set to INFO (generates CPU overhead)
- Some unnecessary memory operations
- Traffic data kept longer than needed

**Optimizations:**
- Set logging to WARN for production
- Optimize memory cleanup intervals
- Reduce data retention periods

## üöÄ Specific Optimizations to Implement

### Phase 1: Settings Optimization
1. **Adjust Cadences for RCL 2-3**
   - Planning: 100 ticks (was 50) - less frequent planning
   - Construction: 15 ticks (was 10) - slightly less frequent
   - Memory updates: 20 ticks (was 10) - reduce overhead

2. **Optimize Logging**
   - Change log level from INFO to WARN
   - Disable creep action logging
   - Disable room update logging

3. **Disable Unnecessary Features**
   - Disable traffic analysis until RCL 3
   - Reduce traffic data TTL
   - Optimize construction site limits

### Phase 2: Creep Body Optimization
1. **RCL 2 Optimized Bodies (300 energy cap)**
   - Harvester: [WORK, WORK, WORK, CARRY, MOVE] = 300 (max harvest efficiency)
   - Upgrader: [WORK, WORK, WORK, CARRY, MOVE] = 300 (max upgrade speed)
   - Builder: [WORK, WORK, CARRY, CARRY, MOVE] = 300 (balanced build/carry)

2. **Energy Threshold Adjustments**
   - Focus on 300 energy bodies for RCL 2
   - Optimize for exact energy capacity usage

### Phase 3: Population Optimization
1. **RCL 2 Population Targets**
   - Harvesters: 2 (one per source)
   - Upgraders: 2-3 (maximize controller work)
   - Builders: 1-2 (based on construction sites)

2. **Dynamic Population**
   - More upgraders when no construction sites
   - More builders during construction phases

### Phase 4: Algorithm Optimizations
1. **Pathfinding Optimization**
   - Cache frequently used paths
   - Optimize creep movement patterns

2. **Construction Site Management**
   - Prioritize high-impact construction sites
   - Limit concurrent construction sites

3. **Memory Cleanup**
   - More aggressive cleanup of old data
   - Optimize memory structure

## üìä Expected Performance Gains

### CPU Usage Reduction:
- **Planning**: 50% reduction (100 tick cadence vs 50)
- **Logging**: 30% reduction (WARN vs INFO level)
- **Traffic Analysis**: 20% reduction (disabled until RCL 3)
- **Memory Operations**: 15% reduction (optimized intervals)

### Energy Efficiency Gains:
- **Harvesting**: 50% more efficient (3 WORK vs 2 WORK harvesters)
- **Upgrading**: 50% faster RCL progression (3 WORK upgraders)
- **Construction**: 25% faster building (optimized builder bodies)

### RCL Progression Speed:
- **Estimated**: 25-40% faster RCL 2 ‚Üí RCL 3 transition
- **Reason**: More efficient upgraders + optimized energy usage
