# Screeps Building and Road Planning System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive building and road planning system for the Screeps AI that provides intelligent room layout planning based on RCL progression, traffic analysis, and terrain adaptation.

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### Step 1: Foundation Setup âœ“

### Step 2: Terrain Analysis System âœ“

  - `identifyKeyPositions()`: Identifies spawns, sources, controller, mineral, exits
  - `findCentralArea()`: Finds optimal central area for base layout
  - `calculateBuildableArea()`: Identifies buildable positions
  - `isSuitableForStructure()`: Structure-specific suitability checks

### Step 3: Layout Templates System âœ“
- **Created `src/planners/LayoutTemplates.ts`**: RCL-based building templates
  - `getTemplate()`: Retrieves templates for specific RCL levels
  - `applyTemplate()`: Applies templates to room with anchor positioning
  - `validateTemplate()`: Validates template structure and limits
  - `getStructureLimits()`: Returns structure limits per RCL
  - Templates for RCL 1-8 with proper structure progression

### Step 4: Building Planning Core âœ“
- **Created `src/planners/BaseLayoutPlanner.ts`**: Main building placement system
  - `planRoom()`: Main planning entry point returning complete `RoomPlan`
  - Hybrid approach: Template-based + dynamic placement
  - `generateBuildingPlan()`: Combines template and dynamic strategies
  - `optimizeBuildingPlan()`: Removes duplicates and optimizes placement
  - `placeConstructionSites()`: Places construction sites based on plan
  - Position scoring algorithms for optimal structure placement

### Step 5: Traffic Analysis System âœ“
- **Created `src/utils/TrafficAnalyzer.ts`**: Creep movement tracking
  - `trackCreepMovement()`: Tracks individual creep movements
  - `trackRoomTraffic()`: Tracks all creeps in a room
  - `analyzeTrafficPatterns()`: Analyzes and processes traffic data
  - `getHighTrafficPositions()`: Identifies positions needing roads
  - `getTrafficHeatmap()`: Provides traffic visualization data
  - Automatic cleanup of old traffic data

### Step 6: Road Planning System âœ“
- **Created `src/planners/RoadPlanner.ts`**: Intelligent road network planning
  - `planRoadNetwork()`: Plans complete road network for room
  - `calculateOptimalPaths()`: Calculates paths between key positions
  - `optimizeRoadPlacement()`: Combines optimal paths with traffic analysis
  - `placeRoadConstructionSites()`: Places road construction sites
  - `updateTrafficAnalysis()`: Updates traffic data for road planning
  - Priority-based road placement with traffic score integration

### Step 7: Manager Integration âœ“
- **Updated `src/managers/RoomManager.ts`**: Integrated planning systems
  - Added planning system execution in room processing loop
  - `runPlanning()`: Executes planning systems on cadence
  - `updateTrafficAnalysis()`: Updates traffic tracking
  - `manageConstructionSites()`: Manages construction site placement
  - `initializeRoomPlan()`: Initializes room plans and terrain analysis
  - RCL change detection and automatic replanning
  - Construction site cleanup and management

### Step 8: Kernel Integration âœ“
- **Updated `src/kernel/Kernel.ts`**: Added planning system support
  - Added periodic planning data cleanup (every 500 ticks)
  - `cleanupPlanningData()`: Cleans old traffic data and layout analysis
  - Construction site status tracking and updates
  - Memory management for planning system data
  - Error handling and logging for planning operations

### Step 9: Testing and Optimization âœ“
- **Created `test_planning_system.js`**: Validation script
  - Tests all planning system components
  - Validates room memory structure
  - Checks construction sites and existing structures
  - Verifies settings configuration
  - Can be run in Screeps console for live testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### Intelligent Building Placement
- **Template-based layouts**: Predefined efficient layouts for each RCL
- **Dynamic placement**: Adapts to unique room terrain when templates don't fit
- **Priority system**: Places most important structures first
- **RCL progression**: Automatically plans new structures as RCL increases

### Smart Road Planning
- **Optimal pathfinding**: Calculates efficient paths between key positions
- **Traffic-based optimization**: Places roads where creeps actually travel
- **Priority scoring**: Combines path importance with actual usage data
- **Adaptive planning**: Updates road plans based on changing traffic patterns

### Traffic Analysis
- **Movement tracking**: Tracks all creep movements in rooms
- **Pattern analysis**: Identifies high-traffic areas needing roads
- **Heat mapping**: Provides traffic visualization for debugging
- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes old traffic data to prevent memory bloat

### Terrain Adaptation
- **Terrain analysis**: Analyzes room terrain for optimal placement
- **Key position identification**: Finds spawns, sources, controller, exits
- **Buildable area calculation**: Identifies suitable building locations
- **Central area detection**: Finds optimal base center location

### Performance Optimization
- **Cadenced execution**: Runs planning on intervals to manage CPU usage
- **Caching systems**: Caches terrain analysis and pathfinding results
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup of old data
- **Error boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling prevents system crashes

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

All planning features can be configured via `src/config/settings.ts`:

```typescript
planning: {
  enabled: true,                    // Master toggle
  planningCadence: 50,             // Ticks between planning runs
  constructionCadence: 10,         // Ticks between construction management
  maxConstructionSites: 5,         // Max construction sites per room
  trafficAnalysisEnabled: true,    // Enable traffic tracking
  roadPlanningEnabled: true,       // Enable road planning
  buildingPlanningEnabled: true,   // Enable building planning
  useTemplates: true,              // Use layout templates
  useDynamicPlacement: true,       // Use dynamic placement
  minTrafficForRoad: 5,           // Min traffic to justify road
  roadPriorityThreshold: 10,      // High priority road threshold
  minTrafficDataPoints: 20,       // Min data before road planning
  constructionSiteMaxAge: 1500,   // Max age for idle sites
}
```

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

### Automatic Operation
The system runs automatically once deployed:
1. **Deploy** the code to your Screeps environment
2. **Planning** begins automatically on the configured cadence
3. **Construction sites** are placed based on room plans
4. **Traffic analysis** tracks creep movements
5. **Roads** are planned based on traffic patterns

### Manual Testing
Use the validation script in the Screeps console:
```javascript
// Run the test function
testPlanningSystem();
```

### Debugging
Enable debug logging in settings:
```typescript
logging: {
  logLevel: 'DEBUG',  // Shows detailed planning information
}
```
