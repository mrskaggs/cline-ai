## Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Small, testable units behind clear contracts
2. **Deterministic Tick**: Priority scheduler with idempotent managers
3. **Config Over Code**: Tune behavior without editing logic
4. **Failure-Safe**: Error boundaries prevent tick crashes
5. **Visibility**: Decisions and KPIs visible in logs
6. **CPU Efficiency**: Cadenced execution and optimized algorithms

## Planning System

### Building Planning
- **RCL Templates**: Predefined layouts for each RCL (1-8) with optimal building placement
- **Dynamic Placement**: Intelligent positioning based on room terrain and key positions
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines templates for reliability with dynamic placement for optimization
- **Priority System**: Buildings placed based on importance and RCL requirements

### Road Planning
- **Traffic Analysis**: Tracks creep movement patterns to identify high-traffic areas
- **Optimal Pathfinding**: Calculates efficient paths between key positions (sources, controller, spawns)
- **Traffic-Based Optimization**: Places roads along most-traveled routes
- **Adaptive Network**: Road network evolves based on actual usage patterns

### Terrain Analysis
- **Room Scanning**: Analyzes terrain to identify buildable areas and obstacles
- **Key Position Detection**: Locates sources, controller, mineral, spawns, and exits
- **Central Area Calculation**: Finds optimal central location for building clusters
- **Buildable Area Mapping**: Identifies suitable positions for different structure types

## RCL Progression Strategy

### RCL 1
- **Harvesters Only**: Multi-purpose creeps handle harvesting, building, and upgrading
- **Population**: 4 harvesters (2 per source minimum)
- **Focus**: Establish basic energy flow and upgrade to RCL2
- **Planning**: Basic spawn placement, prepare for extensions

### RCL 2
- **Specialized Roles**: Dedicated harvesters, builders, and upgraders
- **Buildings**: 5 extensions in cross pattern around spawn
- **Population**: 2 harvesters, 1 upgrader, 1-2 builders
- **Planning**: Extension placement for energy capacity

### RCL 3
- **Defense**: First tower for room defense
- **Logistics**: Hauler role for efficient energy transport from containers
- **Buildings**: Tower + 5 additional extensions (10 total)
- **Population**: 2 harvesters, 2 upgraders, 1-2 builders, 3 haulers (1.5 per source)
- **Planning**: Tower placement for optimal coverage, container-based energy logistics
- **Efficiency**: Haulers transport energy from source containers to spawn/extensions/towers

### RCL 4-8
- **Advanced Structures**: Storage, terminal, labs, factory, etc.

- **Links**: Integration with link networks

### Intelligent Delivery Priority
- **Spawn**: Highest priority for creep production
- **Extensions**: Essential for larger creep spawning
- **Towers**: Defense and repair capabilities
- **Storage**: Excess energy storage
- **Controller Containers**: Support for upgrader operations

### Energy-Optimized Bodies
- **Scaling Design**: Bodies scale from 2-carry (200 energy) to 8-carry (800 energy)
- **Efficient Movement**: Balanced MOVE/CARRY ratio for optimal speed
- **Cost Effective**: Adapts to available energy capacity

### Smart Spawning Logic
- **Container Detection**: Only spawns when containers are available
- **Population Scaling**: 1.5 haulers per source (3 haulers for 2-source rooms)
- **Priority Integration**: Spawns after harvesters but before upgraders/builders

## Scout Role System (RCL 2+)

The Scout role provides intelligence gathering and room exploration for strategic expansion planning:

### Intelligence Gathering
- **Room Exploration**: Systematically explores adjacent rooms for expansion opportunities

- **Room Memory Integration**: Populates both scout data and main room memory structures
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Moves to room center for maximum visibility

### Memory Management
- **Dual Data Storage**: Updates both `scoutData` (intelligence) and `sources` (system compatibility)
- **Timestamp Control**: Only marks rooms as "scouted" when exploration is complete
- **Staleness Detection**: Re-scouts rooms after 1000 ticks for updated intelligence
- **Error Handling**: Marks inaccessible rooms to prevent infinite loops

### Energy-Efficient Design
- **Minimal Body**: Uses only MOVE parts (50-100 energy cost)
- **Smart Spawning**: Only spawns in RCL 2+ rooms with stable economy
- **Priority Integration**: Spawns after essential roles but provides strategic value

### Strategic Intelligence

- **CPU Efficient**: Cadenced analysis to manage computational load

## Memory Structure

The AI maintains structured memory for efficient operation:

```typescript
interface RoomMemory {
  sources: { [id: string]: SourceMemory };
  controllerId?: Id<StructureController>;
  spawnIds: Id<StructureSpawn>[];
  lastUpdated: number;
  rcl: number;
  plan?: RoomPlan;                    // Building and road plans
  trafficData?: TrafficData;          // Traffic analysis data
  layoutAnalysis?: LayoutAnalysis;    // Terrain analysis cache
}

interface RoomPlan {
  roomName: string;
  buildings: PlannedBuilding[];
  roads: PlannedRoad[];
  rcl: number;
  lastUpdated: number;
  status: 'planning' | 'building' | 'ready' | 'complete';
  priority: number;
}

interface CreepMemory {
  role: string;
  homeRoom: string;
  working?: boolean;
  sourceId?: Id<Source>;
  targetId?: Id<Structure | ConstructionSite>;
  hauling?: boolean;                  // Hauler role state tracking
}
```

## Recent Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Construction Site Placement Error Fix (Critical)
- **Issue**: `TypeError: pos.lookFor is not a function` causing RoomManager crashes
- **Root Cause**: Memory serialization strips prototype methods from RoomPosition objects
- **Fix**: Applied RoomPosition reconstruction pattern throughout planning system
- **Files Fixed**: BaseLayoutPlanner.ts, TerrainAnalyzer.ts, RoadPlanner.ts
- **Impact**: Eliminated all construction site placement crashes, system now stable
- **Pattern**: `const roomPos = new RoomPosition(pos.x, pos.y, pos.roomName);`

### Extension Position Mismatch Fix
- **Issue**: ERR_RCL_NOT_ENOUGH errors when placing extensions at RCL 2
- **Root Cause**: Room plan coordinates didn't match actual extension positions

- **Two-Part Issue**: Both hauler delivery priority and StorageManager energy source selection needed fixes
- **Delivery Priority Redesign**: Moved controller containers from Priority 5 to Priority 3 (before storage)
- **New Priority Order**: Spawn → Extensions → **Controller containers** → Towers → Storage (storage now last)
- **StorageManager Fix**: Added controller container exclusion logic to prevent haulers from picking up energy from them
- **Energy Flow Direction**: Haulers now only DELIVER to controller containers, never collect from them
- **Distance-Based Exclusion**: Uses ≤3 range from controller to identify controller containers
- **System Integration**: Both hauler role and StorageManager now consistently exclude controller containers from pickup
- **Complete Solution**: Addresses both delivery priority and collection exclusion for comprehensive fix
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation with all energy flow scenarios - all tests pass
- **Files Modified**: `src/roles/Hauler.ts` (delivery priority), `src/managers/StorageManager.ts` (energy source exclusion)
- **Impact**: Eliminates controller downtime, ensures consistent energy supply for upgraders, enables reliable RCL progression
- **Result**: Controller containers maintain energy for upgraders while storage serves as final energy sink

### Dropped Energy Priority Fix (Latest Achievement)
- **Problem Solved**: Energy decay issue when containers were full - harvesters dropped energy but haulers prioritized containers over dropped energy
- **Root Cause**: Haulers gave dropped energy the LOWEST priority (Priority 3), causing energy to accumulate and slowly decay
- **Complete Priority Redesign**: Moved dropped energy from Priority 3 to Priority 1 (highest priority)
- **New Collection Order**: **Dropped Energy** → StorageManager sources → Source containers (prevents decay)
- **Energy Threshold**: 50+ energy minimum prevents inefficient pickup of tiny amounts
- **Visual Feedback**: Green paths for dropped energy collection, orange for containers
- **System Design Validation**: Confirmed harvester energy dropping is optimal for stationary mining (12×WORK, 1×CARRY, 1×MOVE)
- **Division of Labor**: Harvesters mine continuously, haulers handle all logistics with immediate dropped energy pickup
- **Decay Prevention**: Dropped energy now picked up immediately before it can deteriorate
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation with all priority scenarios - all tests pass
- **Files Modified**: `src/roles/Hauler.ts` (collection priority system)
- **Impact**: Eliminates energy waste from decay, maintains mining efficiency, handles container overflow gracefully
- **Result**: Zero energy loss system - dropped energy collected immediately while maintaining all existing optimizations
