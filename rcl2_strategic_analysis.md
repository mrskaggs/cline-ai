# RCL 2 Strategic Analysis: Remote Mining vs Other Priorities

## RCL 2 Constraints & Capabilities

### What RCL 2 Provides:
- **Energy Capacity**: 300 energy (1 spawn + 5 extensions)
- **Structures**: 1 spawn, 5 extensions, roads, containers (but no towers yet)
- **Creep Limits**: 10 creeps maximum
- **No Claim Parts**: Cannot claim new rooms yet (requires RCL 3)

### What RCL 2 Lacks:
- **No Towers**: Cannot defend remote operations effectively
- **Limited Energy**: 300 energy cap limits creep body sizes
- **No Claim Capability**: Cannot claim/reserve remote rooms
- **Small Creep Population**: Only 10 creeps total

## Remote Mining Analysis at RCL 2

### ‚ùå Why Remote Mining is NOT Optimal at RCL 2:

#### 1. **Security Risk**
- No towers for defense
- Remote creeps are vulnerable to hostile players
- Cannot effectively defend remote operations
- Loss of remote creeps = wasted energy investment

#### 2. **Energy Inefficiency**
- 300 energy cap = weak creeps (max [WORK, WORK, CARRY, MOVE] = 300)
- Remote harvesters need MOVE parts for travel = less WORK parts
- Energy spent on remote creeps could build stronger local infrastructure

#### 3. **Logistics Complexity**
- No containers yet in main room = poor energy storage
- Remote energy transport requires many trips
- CPU overhead of managing remote operations
- Pathfinding costs for long-distance travel

#### 4. **Opportunity Cost**
- 10 creep limit means remote creeps = fewer local creeps
- Local room development suffers
- Slower RCL progression to RCL 3 (where real benefits unlock)

#### 5. **No Room Control**
- Cannot claim/reserve remote rooms until RCL 3
- Remote sources can be contested by other players
- No territorial control or protection

## ‚úÖ Better RCL 2 Priorities

### 1. **Optimize Local Room Development**
- Focus all energy on local infrastructure
- Build all 5 extensions quickly
- Establish efficient local energy flow
- Rush to RCL 3 as fast as possible

### 2. **Perfect Local Logistics**
- 2 efficient harvesters on local sources
- 1-2 upgraders for fast RCL progression
- 1-2 builders for infrastructure
- Optimize creep bodies within 300 energy limit

### 3. **Prepare for RCL 3 Transition**
- Plan container positions
- Prepare for tower defense
- Ready hauler logistics system
- Set up for remote operations AFTER RCL 3

## üìä Energy Math Comparison

### Local Focus (RCL 2):
- **2 Local Sources**: ~20 energy/tick (2 sources √ó 10 energy/tick each)
- **Efficient Harvesters**: [WORK, WORK, CARRY, MOVE] = 300 energy
- **Energy ROI**: Immediate, secure, efficient

### Remote Mining (RCL 2):
- **Remote Harvester**: [WORK, CARRY, MOVE, MOVE] = 250 energy (needs extra MOVE)
- **Hauler**: [CARRY, CARRY, MOVE, MOVE] = 200 energy
- **Total Cost**: 450 energy for weaker remote operation
- **Risk**: Vulnerable to attacks, contested sources

## üéØ Recommended RCL 2 Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Optimization (Current)
1. **Deploy current AI** - it's already optimized for local development
2. **Monitor RCL 2 ‚Üí RCL 3 progression**
3. **Focus on local efficiency and infrastructure**
4. **Rush to RCL 3** for towers and claim parts

### Phase 2: RCL 3 Remote Preparation
1. **Unlock towers** for defense capability
2. **Unlock claim parts** for room control
3. **Implement remote mining** with proper security
4. **Use containers and haulers** for efficient logistics

## üí° Strategic Insight

**Remote mining at RCL 2 is premature optimization.** The constraints (no towers, no claim, 300 energy cap, 10 creep limit) make it inefficient and risky.

**Better approach**: Perfect local operations at RCL 2, then implement remote mining at RCL 3+ when you have:
- Towers for defense
- Claim parts for room control  
- Higher energy capacity for stronger creeps
- Containers and haulers for efficient logistics

## üìã Updated Priority Recommendation

### Immediate (RCL 2):
1. **Deploy current system** - focus on local optimization
2. **Monitor and optimize** local energy efficiency
3. **Rush to RCL 3** as primary goal

### Short-term (RCL 3+):
1. **Implement remote mining** with proper security
2. **Use tower defense** to protect operations
3. **Claim/reserve** remote rooms for control

**Conclusion**: Remote mining should wait until RCL 3. At RCL 2, focus entirely on local optimization and rapid RCL progression.
