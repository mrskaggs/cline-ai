# RCL3 Deployment and Validation Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification ✅

- [x] **Race Condition Fix Implemented**: Scout system has race condition detection and prevention
- [x] **Build Successful**: System compiles to 149.2kb bundle without errors
- [x] **ES2019 Compatibility**: No syntax errors expected in Screeps environment
- [x] **All Systems Integrated**: Scout, Hauler, Builder, Upgrader, SpawnManager all working

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 1. Scout System Validation
**What to look for in console:**

- [ ] **Race Condition Detection**: Watch for "RACE CONDITION DETECTED!" messages
  - If you see these, it confirms the Screeps engine timing issue exists
  - The fix should prevent actual problems despite the detection

- [ ] **Scout Phase Transitions**: Look for messages like:
  ```
  Scout scout_123: Phase=moving, Room=W35N32, Target=W34N32, Home=W35N32
  Scout scout_123: Confirmed arrival at target room W34N32, switching to exploration phase
  Scout scout_123: Starting exploration of W34N32 at tick 12345
  Scout scout_123: Exploration complete for W34N32, gathering final intelligence and returning home
  ```

- [ ] **Room Intelligence Gathering**: Verify scout data appears in Memory:
  ```javascript
  // Check in Screeps console:
  JSON.stringify(Memory.rooms.W34N32.scoutData, null, 2)
  ```

- [ ] **No Room Bouncing**: Scout should stay in target room during exploration phase
  - Previous issue: Scout would enter room then immediately return home
  - Fixed behavior: Scout stays in room for 5+ ticks at center before returning

### 2. RCL3 System Readiness
**Core RCL3 features to verify:**

- [ ] **Extension Count**: Should have exactly 10 extensions (not 20)
  - Check: `Game.rooms.W35N32.find(FIND_MY_STRUCTURES, {filter: {structureType: STRUCTURE_EXTENSION}}).length`

- [ ] **Tower Construction**: Tower should be planned and built
  - Priority: Should build before lower-priority structures

- [ ] **Container System**: 3 containers should be planned
  - 2 source containers (priority 2)
  - 1 controller container (priority 3)

- [ ] **Hauler Spawning**: Haulers should spawn when containers exist
  - Expected: 3 haulers for 2-source room (1.5 per source)
  - Check: `Game.creeps` for creeps with role 'hauler'

### 3. Performance Optimizations
**Verify optimized settings are working:**

- [ ] **Reduced Console Spam**: Should see much less logging
  - Log level set to WARN (not INFO)
  - Spawn logging disabled by default

- [ ] **Efficient Creep Bodies**: 
  - Harvesters: 3 WORK parts (300 energy)
  - Upgraders: 3 WORK parts (300 energy)  
  - Builders: 2 WORK parts (300 energy)

- [ ] **Planning Cadence**: Less frequent planning (every 100 ticks vs 50)

### 4. Construction System
**Verify all construction fixes are working:**

- [ ] **No TypeError Messages**: Should not see "pos.lookFor is not a function"
- [ ] **No ERR_INVALID_TARGET**: Construction sites should place successfully
- [ ] **No ERR_RCL_NOT_ENOUGH**: Structure limits should be correct
- [ ] **Priority Building**: High-priority structures (spawn, extensions, towers) built first

### 5. Road System
**Verify road planning and placement:**

- [ ] **Immediate Road Placement**: Roads appear same tick they're planned
- [ ] **High-Priority Roads**: Source and controller paths built first
- [ ] **No Duplicate Planning**: Single road planning execution per tick

## Troubleshooting Commands

If issues arise, use these console commands in Screeps:

### Force System Reset
```javascript
// Clear room memory to trigger fresh planning
delete Memory.rooms.W35N32.plan;
delete Memory.rooms.W35N32.scoutData;
```

### Check Scout Status
```javascript
// View scout memory and status
Object.values(Game.creeps).filter(c => c.memory.role === 'scout').forEach(scout => {
  console.log(`${scout.name}: Phase=${scout.memory.scoutingPhase}, Room=${scout.room.name}, Target=${scout.memory.targetRoom}`);
});
```

### Validate Structure Counts
```javascript
// Check actual vs planned structure counts
const room = Game.rooms.W35N32;
const extensions = room.find(FIND_MY_STRUCTURES, {filter: {structureType: STRUCTURE_EXTENSION}});
const towers = room.find(FIND_MY_STRUCTURES, {filter: {structureType: STRUCTURE_TOWER}});
const containers = room.find(FIND_STRUCTURES, {filter: {structureType: STRUCTURE_CONTAINER}});
console.log(`Extensions: ${extensions.length}, Towers: ${towers.length}, Containers: ${containers.length}`);
```

### Monitor Race Conditions
```javascript
// Enable detailed scout logging (run once)
Memory.settings = Memory.settings || {};
Memory.settings.logging = Memory.settings.logging || {};
Memory.settings.logging.level = 'DEBUG';
```

## Expected Results

### Immediate (First 100 ticks)
- Scout spawns and begins exploring adjacent rooms
- Construction sites appear for extensions and tower
- Builders prioritize high-priority structures
- No console errors or TypeErrors

### Short-term (100-500 ticks)
- Scout completes exploration of 2-4 adjacent rooms
- Extensions and tower construction progresses
- Container construction sites appear
- Room intelligence data populates in Memory

### Medium-term (500-1000 ticks)
- Containers completed, haulers spawn automatically
- Scout system provides ongoing intelligence updates
- RCL3 progression accelerated by optimized creep bodies
- Stable, error-free operation

## Success Criteria

✅ **Scout System**: No room bouncing, successful intelligence gathering, race condition protection working

✅ **RCL3 Readiness**: Correct structure counts, priority building, hauler integration ready

✅ **Performance**: Reduced CPU usage, optimized creep bodies, clean console output

✅ **Stability**: No errors, robust error handling, graceful degradation

## Next Steps After RCL3

Once RCL3 is achieved and stable:
1. **Storage System**: RCL4+ storage management will activate automatically
2. **Remote Mining**: Use scout intelligence to plan remote mining operations  
3. **Defense Systems**: Tower targeting and room defense strategies
4. **Multi-Room Expansion**: Scale to additional rooms using established patterns

---

**Deployment Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment with comprehensive race condition protection and RCL3 optimization
