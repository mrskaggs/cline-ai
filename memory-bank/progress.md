# Progress

This document tracks the project's status, including what works, what's left to build, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## Current Status: STABLE & FUNCTIONAL

### ✅ Completed Systems

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Kernel System**: Main loop scheduler with CPU guards and error handling
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of dead creeps, old traffic data, and expired plans
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries prevent single failures from crashing ticks
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking

#### Room Management
- **Room Manager**: Scans rooms, populates memory, manages planning systems and tower defense
- **Room Memory**: Structured memory with sources, spawns, controller tracking
- **Defense System**: Automatic tower targeting with focus fire on closest threats

#### Creep Management
- **Spawn Manager**: Calculates required creeps and spawns them based on RCL progression
- **Role System**: Specialized creep behaviors (Harvester, Builder, Upgrader)
- **Population Control**: RCL-based population targets with energy-based body optimization

#### Planning Systems
- **Building Planning**: RCL-based templates (1-8) with dynamic placement optimization
- **Road Planning**: Traffic analysis drives road placement along optimal paths
- **Terrain Analysis**: Room analysis identifies key positions and buildable areas
- **Construction Management**: Priority-based construction site placement and cleanup
- **Traffic Analysis**: Tracks creep movement patterns for road optimization

#### Utilities & Configuration
- **Logger System**: Centralized logging with configurable levels and throttling
- **Settings System**: Comprehensive configuration for all AI behaviors
- **Pathfinding**: Efficient movement with cached cost matrices
- **Traffic Analyzer**: Real-time creep movement tracking and pattern analysis

### 🐛 Recent Bug Fixes

#### Duplicate Road Planning (FIXED)
- **Issue**: RoadPlanner executing twice per tick, wasting CPU
- **Root Cause**: Both `updateBuildingPlan()` and `updateRoadPlan()` called simultaneously
- **Solution**: Added execution tracking to prevent duplicate calls
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - CPU usage optimized, duplicate logs eliminated

#### Road Placement Issue (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Generated 122 roads but none appeared as construction sites
- **Root Cause**: Traffic requirement filtered out all roads in new rooms (no traffic data)
- **Solution**: Allow high-priority roads (priority >= 80) without traffic data
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Critical infrastructure roads now appear immediately

#### Console Logging Spam (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Excessive console output cluttering Screeps interface
- **Solution**: Implemented centralized Logger with throttling and level controls
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Clean console output with meaningful information only

### 🎯 Current Capabilities

#### RCL Progression
- **RCL 1**: ✅ Autonomous bootstrap with harvesters handling all tasks
- **RCL 2**: ✅ Specialized roles with extensions and energy capacity growth
- **RCL 3**: ✅ Tower defense and advanced building placement
- **RCL 4-8**: ✅ Template-based layouts for all advanced structures

#### Planning & Construction
- **Building Templates**: ✅ Complete RCL 1-8 templates with 33+ buildings per room
- **Road Networks**: ✅ Traffic-based road planning with 122+ roads per room
- **Priority System**: ✅ Source paths (100) > Controller paths (90) > Others
- **Construction Sites**: ✅ Intelligent placement with cleanup and age management

#### Performance & Reliability
- **CPU Efficiency**: ✅ Cadenced execution to manage CPU load
- **Error Recovery**: ✅ Graceful degradation when errors occur
