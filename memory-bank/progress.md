### üêõ Recent Bug Fixes

#### Construction Site Placement Errors (CRITICAL - FIXED)
- **Issue**: Multiple TypeError and API errors causing RoomManager crashes
- **Root Causes**: Memory serialization, incorrect structure limits, position mismatches
- **Solutions**: Comprehensive fixes across entire planning system
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - All construction site placement now stable

##### Specific Fixes Applied:
1. **TypeError: pos.lookFor is not a function** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Applied RoomPosition reconstruction in BaseLayoutPlanner, TerrainAnalyzer, RoadPlanner
   - Pattern: Always reconstruct positions from memory before calling methods

2. **ERR_INVALID_TARGET (-10)** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Added comprehensive position validation before construction attempts
   - Validates terrain, boundaries, existing structures, construction sites

3. **ERR_INVALID_ARGS (-10)** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Ensured proper RoomPosition objects passed to createConstructionSite API
   - Reconstructed positions before API calls

4. **ERR_RCL_NOT_ENOUGH (-14)** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Corrected structure limits in LayoutTemplates (5 extensions at RCL 2, not 20)
   - Added automatic detection and replanning of invalid structure counts

5. **Position Mismatch Issues** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Created diagnostic tools to identify plan vs reality mismatches
   - Provided alignment scripts to sync plans with actual room layouts

#### Priority-Based Building System (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Builders going back and forth between construction sites inefficiently
- **Root Cause**: Construction site selection used proximity only, not priority
- **Solution**: Implemented priority-based targeting using existing room plan priorities
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Builders now focus on high-priority structures first
- **Impact**: Faster base development, better CPU efficiency, systematic construction

#### Duplicate Road Planning (FIXED)
- **Issue**: RoadPlanner executing twice per tick, wasting CPU
- **Root Cause**: Both `updateBuildingPlan()` and `updateRoadPlan()` called simultaneously
- **Solution**: Added execution tracking to prevent duplicate calls
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - CPU usage optimized, duplicate logs eliminated

#### Road Placement Issue (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Generated 122 roads but none appeared as construction sites
- **Root Cause**: Traffic requirement filtered out all roads in new rooms (no traffic data)
- **Solution**: Allow high-priority roads (priority >= 80) without traffic data
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Critical infrastructure roads now appear immediately

#### Console Logging Spam (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Excessive console output cluttering Screeps interface
- **Solution**: Implemented centralized Logger with throttling and level controls
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Clean console output with meaningful information only

#### Hauler Controller Container Priority (CRITICAL - FIXED)
- **Issue**: Haulers prioritizing storage over controller containers, causing controller downtime
- **Root Causes**: Two-part issue affecting energy distribution
  1. Hauler delivery priority system had storage before controller containers
  2. StorageManager at RCL 4+ returned controller containers as valid energy sources
- **Solutions**: Complete priority system redesign and StorageManager fix
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - Controller containers now get energy before storage

##### Specific Fixes Applied:
1. **Hauler Delivery Priority Redesign** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Moved controller containers from Priority 5 to Priority 3 (before storage)
   - Storage moved from Priority 4 to Priority 5 (last priority)
   - New order: Spawn ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Controller containers ‚Üí Towers ‚Üí Storage

2. **StorageManager Energy Source Exclusion** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Added controller container exclusion logic to `getOptimalEnergySources()`
   - Uses same distance check as hauler fallback (‚â§3 range from controller)
   - Prevents haulers from picking up energy from controller containers

3. **Complete System Integration** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Both hauler role and StorageManager now exclude controller containers from pickup
   - Controller containers serve as delivery-only targets for upgraders
   - Comprehensive testing validates all energy flow scenarios
