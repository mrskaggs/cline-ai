## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### Console Logging Improvements
- **Issue**: Excessive console output was cluttering the Screeps console
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive logging system with proper controls

#### Changes Made:
1. **Created Logger Utility** (`src/utils/Logger.ts`)
   - Centralized logging with level controls (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Throttled logging to prevent spam
   - Configurable via settings
   - Automatic cleanup of old log entries

2. **Updated All Components to Use Logger**
   - `Kernel.ts`: Uses Logger, only logs loading once per global reset
   - `SpawnManager.ts`: Uses Logger, spawn logging now configurable
   - `RoomManager.ts`: Uses Logger for error handling
   - `Upgrader.ts`: Removed unnecessary console.log

3. **Adjusted Default Settings**
   - Changed log level from 'INFO' to 'WARN' to reduce noise
   - Disabled spawn logging by default
   - Kept error and warning logging enabled for debugging

#### Benefits:
- Dramatically reduced console spam
- Better control over what gets logged
- Configurable logging levels for different environments
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Consistent logging format with timestamps and context

## Current State
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Build process working correctly (27.9kb bundle)
- Logging system fully integrated
- **FIXED**: Resolved SyntaxError in Screeps environment:
  - Replaced `new Date().toISOString()` with static string to avoid Date constructor
  - Replaced all optional chaining operators (`?.`) with traditional null checks
  - Screeps environment doesn't support ES2020 optional chaining syntax
- Ready for deployment to Screeps server

## Next Steps
- Deploy to Screeps and verify reduced console output
- Monitor performance and adjust logging levels as needed
- Consider adding more granular logging controls for specific components
