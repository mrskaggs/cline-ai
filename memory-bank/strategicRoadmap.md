# Strategic Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development path for the Screeps AI project, including next steps, priorities, and long-term vision. This roadmap is essential for future development sessions and strategic decision-making.

## üéØ Current Status: PRODUCTION READY
The Screeps AI is **fully functional** with complete RCL 1-8 support, including:
- ‚úÖ Tower defense, container logistics, hauler roles
- ‚úÖ Priority-based construction, traffic-optimized roads
- ‚úÖ ES2019 compatible, all bugs fixed, comprehensive testing
- ‚úÖ Ready for immediate deployment to Screeps

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)

### 1. Deploy & Monitor
**Goal**: Get the AI running in Screeps and validate real-world performance
**Actions**:
- Deploy `dist/main.js` to Screeps environment
- Monitor RCL 2 ‚Üí RCL 3 transition in real-time
- Watch for tower defense activation and hauler spawning
- Verify construction priorities working correctly

**Success Metrics**:
- 5 extensions built at RCL 2
- Tower + containers appear at RCL 3
- Haulers spawn automatically when containers exist
- Clean console output with meaningful logs only

### 2. Performance Optimization
**Goal**: Fine-tune CPU usage and efficiency based on real gameplay
**Potential Areas**:
- Monitor CPU usage patterns during peak construction
- Adjust planning cadences if needed (currently 50 ticks for planning, 10 for construction)
- Optimize traffic analysis frequency if CPU becomes tight
- Review logger levels for production environment

## üéØ Short-term Enhancements (Priority 2)

### 3. Remote Mining Operations (RCL 3+ ONLY)
**Goal**: Expand beyond single-room operations for faster growth
**Timing**: Wait until RCL 3+ (NOT beneficial at RCL 2)
**Implementation**:
- Remote harvester roles for nearby source rooms
- Claim/reserve room logic for expansion (requires RCL 3 claim parts)
- Remote road planning and construction
- Defensive measures for remote operations (requires towers)

**Why Wait for RCL 3+**:
- RCL 2 lacks towers for defense (remote creeps vulnerable)
- 300 energy cap = weak remote creeps (inefficient)
- No claim parts until RCL 3 (cannot secure remote rooms)
- 10 creep limit = opportunity cost vs local development
- Better to rush RCL 3 with local focus, then expand

**Benefits**: Faster energy income, accelerated RCL progression (but only at RCL 3+)

### 4. Advanced Combat System
**Goal**: Handle more complex threats beyond basic tower defense
**Implementation**:
- Scout role for threat detection
- Military creep roles (attackers, healers, defenders)
- Squad coordination and formation movement
- Automatic response to invasion threats

**Benefits**: Better survival in competitive environments

### 5. Market Integration
**Goal**: Automate resource trading for optimal growth
**Implementation**:
- Market analysis and price tracking
- Automatic buy/sell orders for resources
- Surplus energy conversion to credits
- Strategic resource acquisition

**Benefits**: Accelerated development, resource optimization

## üéØ Medium-term Advanced Features (Priority 3)

### 6. Multi-Room Empire Management
**Goal**: Coordinate multiple rooms as a unified empire
**Implementation**:
- Empire-level resource sharing
- Coordinated defense strategies
- Specialized room roles (mining, military, production)
- Inter-room logistics and supply chains

### 7. Factory & Power Management
**Goal**: Automate high-level resource production
**Implementation**:
- Factory automation for commodity production
- Power creep management and optimization
- Advanced resource processing chains
- Power bank harvesting operations

### 8. Advanced AI Behaviors
**Goal**: Implement sophisticated decision-making
**Implementation**:
- Dynamic strategy adaptation based on environment
- Machine learning for traffic optimization
- Predictive planning based on historical data
- Adaptive threat response systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements (Ongoing)

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- **Refactoring**: Continuously improve code organization
- **Testing**: Expand test coverage for edge cases
- **Documentation**: Keep memory bank updated with new features
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize hot code paths

### Development Tools
- **Debugging**: Enhanced logging and diagnostic tools
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance dashboards
- **Simulation**: Local testing environment for new features
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

## üìã Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Deploy & Stabilize
1. Deploy current system to Screeps
2. Monitor performance and fix any deployment issues
3. Fine-tune settings based on real-world performance
4. Document any production-specific configurations

### Week 2-3: Remote Mining
1. Implement remote harvester role
2. Add room claiming/reserving logic
3. Extend road planning to remote rooms
4. Test remote operations in safe environments

### Week 4+: Choose Your Path
Based on Screeps environment and goals:
- **Competitive Environment**: Focus on combat and defense
- **Cooperative Environment**: Focus on market and optimization
- **Learning Focus**: Implement advanced AI behaviors
- **Expansion Focus**: Multi-room empire management

## üí° Strategic Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Deploy current system first, then add complexity
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch real-world performance before adding features
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Small improvements are better than large rewrites
4. **Document Everything**: Keep memory bank updated with new learnings
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Use comprehensive test suite for new features

## üîÑ Development Philosophy

The AI has moved beyond the "getting it working" phase into the "strategic expansion" phase. The foundation is rock-solid - future development is about choosing which advanced capabilities align with Screeps goals and environment.

Key insight: This is no longer about fixing fundamental issues, but about expanding reach and capabilities based on strategic priorities.

## üìù Notes for Future Sessions

- The current system is production-ready and deployment-capable
- All major bugs have been resolved and comprehensive testing is in place
- The next phase requires strategic decision-making about which advanced features to prioritize
- Performance optimization should be based on real-world deployment data
- The memory bank should be updated with learnings from each development phase
